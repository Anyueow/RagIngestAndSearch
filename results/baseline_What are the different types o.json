  "response": " The provided context does not mention any specific type of embeddings. Embeddings are a concept used in machine learning, particularly in natural language processing and computer vision tasks, where the high-dimensional data is transformed into a lower-dimensional space to improve model performance or facilitate computations. Examples of embedding types include word embeddings (word2vec, GloVe), image embeddings (CNN feature vectors), and document embeddings (Doc2Vec). The context provided pertains to databases and database management systems, not machine learning concepts like embeddings."
